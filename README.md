This is my responsive portfolio website, created using Bootstrap services.

As specified in the assignment requirements, the site is made up of three pages: Home, Portfolio, and Contact.

The home page contains a 'jumbotron' component to greet and introduce the site, as well as three containers for main content:
1. Welcome message
2. Bio and personal facts
3. Social media links

The portfolio page is made up of eight designs that I created for school and work. The responsive aspect of the website is most apparent here, as the columns shift based on the size of the screen. Additionally, the images will light up if the cursor is hovered over them.

Finally, the contact page was created using the 'form' component of Bootstrap. It allows users to input their name, email, and message, before clicking submit to complete the process.

Thank you for visiting my porfolio website!
